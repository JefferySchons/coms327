	started on dungion_main.c and dungion_make_dungion.c. I amed these two seperate
becouse i will need to call make_dungion (what makes the dungion map) eventualy and
might as well do it from the start. dungoion_main right now will only call make_dungion
untill more is added
September 2; 5:15pm
	finished dungion_map() so tha it correctly displayes the romes and they
are stored in a array of room structs. TODO make hallways
September 2; 6:15pm
	made hallways work. TODO find out why some rooms seam disconected occationaly
September 3; 10:30am tried to figure why some rooms are not connecter and odd hallways
September 5, 6  Found why its making more rooms then needed (when seting room count to
2 it sometimes made 3) I was cycling through the entire room_placement_array every time
its reset i made extra rooms
September 6 8pm Found the bug with odd hallways, both the vertical andhorisonatal
hallways originate from teh corner of the room (not squaring). TODO
make up down, strait up down, and add up downhallways to left right
	8:20 fixed it by redefining what next_room_number is (before checking if its 
the last and redefining it) instead of having it count up every loop
September 7: rolled the assignment 1.01 into the tarball for submition
