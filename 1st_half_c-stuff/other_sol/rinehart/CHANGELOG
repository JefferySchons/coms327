9/18/16 9:40pm: Began project. Moved hardness to a struct, removed unused functions from last week.
				Introduced and rectified several errors where if(!ROOM == X) should have had parens
				Or used a !=. Finished random player placement.
9/19/16 3:40pm: Considered some major restructuring. Decided against it.
		9:19pm: Wrestled with Jeremy's code for far too long before deciding (again) to attempt to 
				Write my own dijkstra. I'll try to utilize the provided data structure, but my hopes
				Aren't high.
		10:38pm:Well I finished dijkstra except everything is -1 and it's not good.
9/20/16 1:06am: Fixed dijkstra. Was a problem with unsigned character overflow. Now I just need
				To account for walls, and for diagonals being the same. Both should be fairly trivial
		10:31am: Fixed walls issue, not behaving as expected. Will investigate
		11:16am: Fixed wall issue better. All that's left is diagonals. 
		11:36am: Fixed diagonals. Will meet rest of spec tonight.
		12:25pm: Realized I neglected to include tunnelling code. 
		2:25pm:  Finished project.
		9:37pm:  Fixed a bug related to printing (misplaced newline distorted a print)
