My program does not deviate from the standard. It prints the dungeon normally,
followed by the distances of walls only, followed by all of the distances.
I used multiple arrays, stored in a struct. One for hardness, one for occupants,
One for the nodes, and so on. I use the provided Fibonacci heap for Dijkstra's sorting.
