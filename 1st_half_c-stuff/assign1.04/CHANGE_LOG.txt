	started on dungion_main.c and dungion_make_dungion.c. I amed these two seperate
becouse i will need to call make_dungion (what makes the dungion map) eventualy and
might as well do it from the start. dungoion_main right now will only call make_dungion
untill more is added
September 2; 5:15pm
	finished dungion_map() so tha it correctly displayes the romes and they
are stored in a array of room structs. TODO make hallways
September 2; 6:15pm
	made hallways work. TODO find out why some rooms seam disconected occationaly
September 3; 10:30am tried to figure why some rooms are not connecter and odd hallways
September 5, 6  Found why its making more rooms then needed (when seting room count to
2 it sometimes made 3) I was cycling through the entire room_placement_array every time
its reset i made extra rooms
September 6 8pm Found the bug with odd hallways, both the vertical andhorisonatal
hallways originate from teh corner of the room (not squaring). TODO
make up down, strait up down, and add up downhallways to left right
	8:20 fixed it by redefining what next_room_number is (before checking if its 
the last and redefining it) instead of having it count up every loop
September 7: rolled the assignment 1.01 into the tarball for submition

//forgot to update change log for 1.02 (sep 7-14)
// load save didnt work, tried to use teachers code (hard to understand)
September 17: read teachers code, wrote skelliten for code

September 19: wrote the pathfinding function (both through wall and not)

September 21: made thee print function work for these, it encodes the 
distance to alpha numeric in print function

September 22: in class the teacher mentioned that we did not have to include
the save/load in future projects so I decided to redo 1.03 using my 1.01 and 
not have a save/load.

September 25: sunday using the code i had writen made the pathfinding function

September 26: finished the pathfinding functions, had a probem with the printing

September 27: fixed problem with printing (need to cast the array and print char)
	code is done
	
September 30: got all of the structs made, the creature struct is used for both
	pc and monsters, also have a array of creatures where [0] is pc.

October 3: mon  got PC wondering around randomly
October 4: tues, got the line of sight done
October 5: got the monsters to chase and kill PC
