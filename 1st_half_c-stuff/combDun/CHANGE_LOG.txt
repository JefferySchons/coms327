	started on dungion_main.c and dungion_make_dungion.c. I amed these two seperate
becouse i will need to call make_dungion (what makes the dungion map) eventualy and
might as well do it from the start. dungoion_main right now will only call make_dungion
untill more is added
September 2; 5:15pm
	finished dungion_map() so tha it correctly displayes the romes and they
are stored in a array of room structs. TODO make hallways
September 2; 6:15pm
	made hallways work. TODO find out why some rooms seam disconected occationaly
September 3; 10:30am tried to figure why some rooms are not connecter and odd hallways
